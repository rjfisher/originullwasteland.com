I think the biggest struggle of my late 30's and early 40's has been a growing sense of cognitive dissonance between how people work and how society, at large, works.  I am consistently impressed with people and the informal, impromptu systems that *people* have created.  The fact that tens of thousands of people can travel to a concert, experience an often transcendental experience, and then travel home without mass violence breaking out is always wildly impressive to me.  Similarly, the fact that driving anywhere with heavy traffic isn't the site of daily, extreme violence speaks loudly to the non-violence of humans.  In the words of the incomparable Fred Rogers, ["look for the helpers"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LGHtc_D328) is consistently shown to be prophetic as in every emergency there are those people who are more concerned with the safety and well-being of others above their own.

But this optimism stands solidly in opposition to the explicit rules of the society that "we" have built.
